# ProjectOnAutomationAndScraping
I made projects using Puppeteer in NodeJS . 

**project.js** -->This file uses credential.json file .It first scrapes latest news update from timesofindia website and then writes the news into news.json file and then uses the same news to post on Reddit.

**pinpuppeteer.js** --> This file uses credential.json and logs into account on pinterest and on preference of user ,search a catergory and saves n number of pins to the board.
